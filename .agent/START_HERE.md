## 🎯 First-Time Setup

### Step 1: Verify AI Can See This File

If you're reading this in an AI chat (Claude, Gemini, etc.), **you're good to go!** ✅

### Step 2: Activate the Agent System

Type this in your AI chat:

```
wake up [agent-name]
```
*(Check .agent/GEMINI.md for the default name or use the one you set during installation)*

The AI will:
- ✅ Load **GEMINI.md** (Identity & language protocol)
- ✅ Enable **Scale-Adaptive Architecture**
- ✅ Activate **Scientific Linkage** (DNA - Rules - Skills)
- ✅ Load **600+ specialized capabilities**

## 🤖 How It Works

### **Automatic Skill Activation**

The AI will automatically:
1. Analyze your requests.
2. Select the best specialist agent(s) (Intelligent Routing).
3. Ask clarifying questions when needed (Socratic Gate).
4. Apply best practices from the 26 Master Skills.

### **PDCA Cycle (Standard Operating Procedure)**

AI follows a rigorous flow:
1. **Plan**: Outline the task and create a checklist.
2. **Do**: Execute the implementation.
3. **Check**: Verify results against the plan.
4. **Act**: Refactor, optimize, and finalize.
