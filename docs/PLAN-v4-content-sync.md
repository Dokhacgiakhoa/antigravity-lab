# PLAN - v4 Content Sync & Alignment

## 🎯 Goal
Update `antigravity-lab` content (Home, Guide, Tutorial, README) to align 100% with the `google-antigravity` v4.0.0 specifications, architectural philosophy (Scale-Adaptive), and technical stats (26 Master Skills, 600+ Capabilities).

---

## 🏗️ Phase -1: Context Check
- **Current Stats**: v3.5.30 (22 Skills, 11 Workflows)
- **Target Stats**: v4.0.0 (26 Skills, 17 Workflows, 15 Specialists)
- **Key Concepts to Add**: 
  - Scale-Adaptive Architecture (Solo-Ninja, Agile-Squad, Software-Factory).
  - Scientific Linkage (DNA - Rules - Skills).
  - PDCA Cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act).

---

## 🛠️ Phase 0: Socratic Gate (Verified)
- **Intent**: Synchronize lab content with core project docs.
- **Domain**: Documentation, Marketing, Developer Experience.
- **Complexity**: Medium (Multiple UI pages and README files).
